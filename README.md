# ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 Educational Project

This project is dedicated to exploring the ESP32-S3 MCU, specifically the `esp32-s3-devkitc-1-n16r8v` development board. It provides a simple example program that outputs information about the board and sets up the LittleFS filesystem on the flash memory.

## Features

- **Board Information**: Displays details about the ESP32-S3 board, including flash and CPU frequency.
- **LittleFS Filesystem**: Configures and mounts the LittleFS filesystem on the flash.

## TODO

- **Debug over USB JTAG Interface**  
  Enable debugging using the onboard USB JTAG.

- **RGB LED Control**  
  Test and implement RGB LED functionality on the board.

- **LittleFS Testing**  
  Explore read/write operations with the LittleFS filesystem.
